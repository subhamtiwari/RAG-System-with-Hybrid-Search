# **RAG System with Hybrid Search and Generative AI Models**

## **Project Overview**

This project showcases a scalable Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that leverages a **hybrid search architecture** using **Faiss** for vector-based semantic search and **Elasticsearch** for keyword-based search. This combination ensures high relevance and accuracy in document retrieval. The generative component uses advanced **LLMs (Large Language Models)**, such as **Flan-T5** and **LLaMA**, to provide natural language responses to user queries based on the retrieved documents.

The project was built with modular components, integrating **LangChain** for document processing, **SentenceTransformers** for embeddings, **Faiss** and **Elasticsearch** for hybrid retrieval, and multiple LLMs for text generation.

## **Features**

1. **Document Preprocessing and Chunking:** Automatically splits documents into manageable chunks for more effective retrieval and generation.
2. **Hybrid Retrieval System:** Combines **Faiss** and **Elasticsearch** to handle both semantic and keyword-based searches.
3. **LLM-Based Response Generation:** Supports advanced LLMs such as **Flan-T5** and **LLaMA** for coherent, context-aware responses.
4. **Flexible Architecture:** Modular design allows easy switching of different components like embeddings, retrieval, and generation models.
5. **Scalability:** The system can be extended to handle different document formats and various retrieval methods.

## **Architecture**

Below is a high-level architecture of the RAG system:

1. **Document Loading:** Uses **LangChain** document loaders (`UnstructuredPDFLoader` and `UnstructuredWordDocumentLoader`) to read PDFs and DOCX files.
2. **Document Chunking:** Splits documents into smaller, manageable chunks using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`.
3. **Embedding Generation:** Uses **SentenceTransformers** for generating high-quality embeddings.
4. **Vector Storage and Retrieval:** Embeddings are stored in **Faiss** for semantic similarity search.
5. **Keyword-Based Search:** Uses **Elasticsearch** for keyword-based matching.
6. **LLM-Based Response Generation:** Generates human-like responses using Flan-T5 or a locally hosted LLaMA model.

This architecture ensures that the system can efficiently handle a variety of document formats and produce accurate and contextually relevant responses.

## **Setup Instructions**

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/rag-hybrid-search.git
   cd rag-hybrid-search
   ```

2. **Set Up the Virtual Environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Required Libraries:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Alternatively, you can manually install the necessary libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install langchain transformers sentence-transformers faiss-cpu pdfminer.six docx requests openai
   ```

4. **Download and Configure LLM Models:**

   - If using **LLaMA**, ensure you have a locally hosted LLaMA server.
   - If using **Flan-T5**, no additional setup is required as it uses the Hugging Face Transformers library.

5. **Set Up Elasticsearch (Optional for Hybrid Search):**

   - Download and install [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch).
   - Start the Elasticsearch server locally or connect to an existing instance.

## **Running the Project**

1. **Start the Script:**

   ```bash
   python rag_project.py
   ```

2. **Upload Documents:**
   - When prompted, enter the folder path containing your documents (PDFs, DOCX).
   
3. **Run Queries:**
   - Enter your query, and the system will retrieve the most relevant chunks using hybrid search and generate a response using the specified LLM.

4. **Check Output:**
   - The system will display the combined context, along with the generated response.

## **Project Highlights**

1. **Hybrid Search Approach:**
   The project uses both **Faiss** and **Elasticsearch**, combining the advantages of vector-based and keyword-based searches. This hybrid approach significantly improved the relevance of retrieved documents and the quality of generated responses.

2. **Flexible LLM Integration:**
   Supports **Flan-T5** and **LLaMA** for text generation. Switching between these models allowed testing different response generation strategies and fine-tuning the model for various scenarios.

3. **Real-World Application Potential:**
   The system can be adapted for real-world applications such as chatbots, document analysis, and content recommendation systems in the financial, healthcare, or legal domains.

## **Future Work**

1. **Multi-Modal Retrieval:** Extend the RAG system to handle image-based documents and perform OCR to include images in the context.
2. **Advanced Ranking Mechanisms:** Implement relevance feedback and active learning to continuously improve retrieval accuracy.
3. **Distributed Systems:** Scale the RAG system to handle larger datasets and complex queries using distributed architectures like Apache Kafka.

### **Quick Tips:**

1. **To use Elasticsearch**, ensure the server is running before executing the script.
2. **To switch LLM models**, modify the `generate_response_with_llama` function in the main script.
